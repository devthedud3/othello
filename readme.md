## Description

The Othello is a classic two-player board game also known as Reversi. This project is an implementation of the Othello game in Python, featuring a graphical user interface built with Tkinter. The game allows two players to take turns and compete to flip their opponent's discs to their color. The player with the most discs of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Two-player mode for head-to-head gameplay.
- Built-in logic for valid move validation and disc flipping.
- Displays the current score and winner at the end of the game.
